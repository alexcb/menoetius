Menoetius is a timeseries storage system designed to store prometheus-compatible data.

Build requirements:
 - make
 - gcc
 - libmicrohttpd
 - libcrypto
 - libcunit (for testing only)

Building:

    make

Running tests:

    ./test

Running the server:

    MENOETIUS_STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/storage_path ./server

Building a deb package: a dockerfile is provided for building a debian package, first
install docker, then run:

Writing data to the server: currently we only have a client library available
(see src/client/client.h), additionally the src/smoketest directory contains
examples of using the client.
